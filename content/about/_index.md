I'm an Associate Professor of Digital Humanities in the Department of History at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.

No one is more surprised by this than me.

#### Interests
+ Computational Creativity for History & Archaeology
+ Open Access Everything
+ Digital Public History & Archaeology

![This is me][1]

I'm currently working on things like machine learning and the dodgy trade in human remains, a textbook on digital archaeology with its own integrated computer, and building a journal for creativity in history and archaeology called [Epoiesen](http://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca). The journal will probably go live sometime in the Fall 2017 term.

#### Education

+ PhD in Archaeology, 2002, University of Reading
+ MA City of Rome, 1998, University of Reading
+ BA Hons, Archaeology, 1997 Wilfrid Laurier University
