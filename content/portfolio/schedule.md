Meeting times and other important information

<!--more-->

_Because our class meets irregularly on a Monday, various holidays and long weekends mean that we could go for quite some time before seeing one another. To mitigate this, our first in-person meeting will not happen until **October 2nd**, though you will have work to do before that meeting. I also expect that you will make use of our chat space in Slack during the intervals._

I would like to meet with you individually before we meet as a group. Please email me at shawn dot graham at carleton dot ca to make an appointment.

Before our **first meeting as a group**:

1. Get all of the required accounts
2. Explore and annotate as you go through this website (syllabus, assessment, schedule, potential topics), responding at least initially with the 3w's to guide you [(if you missed that, they're over here)](/portfolio/assessment). Remember to make all of your annotations as part of the DHCU group
3. Explore the variety of topics on the main page of this site
4. Select your top three preferred topics where you would be prepared to take a leadership role, and indicate this by making an annotation RIGHT HERE to that effect. You may also wish to take that opportunity to reflect on what is missing from the potential topics.
5. Take a look at my [digital history workbook](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca) and study how it is organized

During our first meeting on October 2nd, we will work together to set up our open notebooks, and to learn some basic version control and collaboration software (see [tutorials](/portfolio/tutorials/)). We will discuss how this class is set up, the kind of work I am expecting from you, and we will decide which topics we would like to discuss when, filling out the schedule below. We will also explore the current state of play regarding '[open educational resources](/portfolio/publishing/).'
